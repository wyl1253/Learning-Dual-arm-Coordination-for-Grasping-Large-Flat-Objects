### About this repository

This repository provides the paper's implementation and large flat objects datasets.
Please note that since the robot platform is currently limited to internal use within our lab, we have only made the essential models and object files (URDF) publicly available.

If you are unable to develop your manipulator URDFs, you can refer to the following open-source repositories for ready-to-use robot models:

- [OmniIsaacGymEnvs-UR10Reacher](https://github.com/j3soon/OmniIsaacGymEnvs-UR10Reacher)  
- [ur5_isaac_simulation](https://github.com/caiobarrosv/ur5_isaac_simulation)  
- [pmbs](https://github.com/arc-l/pmbs)
